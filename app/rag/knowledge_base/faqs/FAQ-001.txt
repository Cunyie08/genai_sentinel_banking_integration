SECTION 1: TRANSFER & PAYMENT ISSUES
=========================================================================

Q1: My transfer was debited but the receiver didn't get the money. 
    What should I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: This is usually a temporary delay in the interbank network. Here's 
   what to do:

   1. Wait 2 hours first (most delays resolve automatically)
   2. Check your transaction history for the transaction reference number
   3. Confirm the account number you sent to (verify with recipient)
   4. If still not received after 2 hours:
      - Contact us with your transaction reference
      - We can track it through NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System)
      - We will resolve within 48 hours
   5. If money doesn't reach within 24 hours:
      - Automatic reversal will occur
      - You'll get SMS notification when credited back

   **Important**: Keep your transaction reference number handy!
   Format: NIP/240217/1234567890


Q2: Why was my transfer to another bank delayed?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Inter-bank transfers use the NIBSS network which can have delays during:

   **Peak Traffic Periods**:
   - Month-end (25th-30th): Salary payment days
   - First week of month: Rent payment period
   - Friday evenings: High transaction volume

   **Network Maintenance**:
   - Usually announced in advance
   - Typically done between 2 AM - 6 AM
   - Check our app for maintenance notifications

   **Public Holidays**:
   - Processing resumes next business day
   - Transactions submitted on Friday evening may process Monday morning

   **Normal Processing Time**: 2-5 minutes
   **Acceptable Delay**: Up to 2 hours during peak periods
   **Beyond 2 hours**: Please report to us for investigation

   **Pro Tip**: For urgent transfers, send before 3 PM on weekdays.


Q3: I sent money to the wrong account number. Can you reverse it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Unfortunately, we CANNOT automatically reverse transfers sent to the 
   wrong account. Here's why and what you can do:

   **Why We Can't Auto-Reverse**:
   - Once money enters the recipient's account, only they can return it
   - Banking regulations don't allow forced reversals
   - Recipient has legal right to the funds (until proven otherwise)

   **What You Should Do**:
   Step 1: Contact the recipient IMMEDIATELY
           - Call or text the phone number linked to that account
           - Explain the error and request a refund
           - Many people are honest and will refund

   Step 2: If recipient refuses or is unreachable:
           - Report to us with evidence:
             * Screenshot of wrong account number entered
             * Proof of your intended recipient
             * Any communication with wrong recipient
           - We will contact the recipient's bank
           - Recovery process can take 14-21 days

   Step 3: Legal action (last resort):
           - If recipient refuses despite bank's intervention
           - You can file a civil case for recovery
           - Keep all evidence (transaction receipts, messages)

   **PREVENTION TIP**: 
   Always use the "Name Enquiry" feature before sending money!
   - Enter account number
   - System shows you the account name
   - VERIFY it matches your intended recipient
   - Then proceed with transfer


Q4: What is the maximum amount I can transfer per day?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: It depends on your account KYC (Know Your Customer) tier:

   **Tier 1 (Basic)**: ₦50,000 per day
   - Requirements: Name + Phone number only
   - Limited features

   **Tier 2 (Intermediate)**: ₦200,000 per day
   - Requirements: Tier 1 + BVN + NIN
   - Mobile app access

   **Tier 3 (Full KYC)**: ₦5,000,000 per day
   - Requirements: Tier 2 + Address proof + ID + Utility bill
   - Full banking services

   **How to Upgrade Your Account**:
   Visit any branch with:
   - Valid ID (Driver's license, International passport, Voter's card, NIN)
   - Utility bill (NEPA, LAWMA, water bill - not older than 3 months)
   - BVN (if not already captured)
   - Passport photograph

   **Processing Time**: Same day (if you visit before 2 PM)


=========================================================================
SECTION 2: CARD ISSUES
=========================================================================

Q5: Why was my card declined even though I have money in my account?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Cards can be declined for MANY reasons. Here are the most common:

   **1. International Transaction (Card Not Enabled)**
   - Your card is disabled for foreign transactions by default
   - Enable it in the app: Cards → Manage Card → International ON
   - Set your travel dates (auto-disables when you return)

   **2. Insufficient Funds (Including Pending Transactions)**
   - Check your AVAILABLE balance (not just book balance)
   - You may have pending transactions not yet visible
   - Example: Hotel pre-authorization holds funds for 3-7 days

   **3. Daily Limit Exceeded**
   - POS limit: ₦500,000 per day
   - ATM limit: ₦100,000 per day (standard) or ₦200,000 (premium)
   - Limit resets at midnight

   **4. Security Block**
   - Suspicious activity detected (multiple failed PIN attempts)
   - Card temporarily blocked for your protection
   - Contact us to unblock

   **5. Expired Card**
   - Check expiry date (MM/YY format on your card)
   - Request new card if expired

   **6. Incorrect PIN**
   - After 3 wrong PIN attempts, card auto-locks for 24 hours
   - Do NOT keep trying (makes it worse)
   - Reset your PIN via app or call us

   **7. Merchant Category Blocked**
   - Betting/gambling sites blocked by default (can be enabled)
   - Some international merchants blocked (contact us to allow)

   **8. Technical Issue with Merchant's Terminal**
   - Try a different POS terminal
   - Or pay with transfer instead

   **What to Do If Declined**:
   - Check available balance in app
   - Verify card expiry date
   - Try a different merchant/terminal if possible
   - If still declining, contact us: 0700-SENTINEL


Q6: The ATM didn't give me cash but my account shows debit. What do I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: This is called a "dispense error" or "ATM reversal case". Here's the 
   exact procedure:

   **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (Do this NOW):
   1. DO NOT retry the same ATM immediately
      (It will debit you again!)

   2. Note these details:
      - Exact ATM location (bank name, branch, street address)
      - Time of transaction (check your SMS alert)
      - Amount you tried to withdraw
      - Your account number

   3. Check if ATM printed a receipt
      - If yes: Keep it safely (it's evidence)
      - If no: No problem, we can still help

   **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT**:
   - Contact us within 24 hours (CRITICAL for quick resolution)
   - We initiate terminal reconciliation:
     * Count cash remaining in ATM
     * Compare with transaction records
     * If cash count shows your money still in machine → Reversal approved
   
   - Automatic reversal usually happens within 24-48 hours
   - You'll get SMS: "₦X has been credited back to your account. 
     Reference: REV/240217/XXXX. Sorry for the inconvenience."

   **IF DELAY OCCURS**:
   - For complex cases: We may issue temporary credit while investigating
   - Maximum investigation time: 7 days
   - 90% of dispense errors are reversed within 24 hours

   **STATISTICS** (So you know this is normal):
   - Dispense errors: ~0.01% of ATM transactions
   - Successful reversal rate: 99.8%
   - Average reversal time: 18 hours


Q7: How do I enable my card for international transactions?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: For security, international transactions are DISABLED by default.
   Here's how to enable:

   **METHOD 1: Via Mobile App** (Easiest)
   1. Open Sentinel Bank app
   2. Login with your password/biometric
   3. Tap "Cards" menu at bottom
   4. Select the card you want to enable
   5. Tap "Manage Card"
   6. Toggle "International Transactions" to ON (green)
   7. Set your travel dates:
      - Travel start date
      - Travel end date
      - Card will auto-disable when you return (for your security)
   8. Done! Card is now active for international use

   **METHOD 2: Via Customer Service**
   1. Call 0700-SENTINEL (0700-736-8463)
   2. Request international activation
   3. Provide:
      - Card number (last 4 digits)
      - Travel destination
      - Travel dates
   4. Representative will enable within 5 minutes
   5. You'll get SMS confirmation

   **IMPORTANT NOTES**:
   - Some countries require additional verification
     (We may request your flight itinerary for compliance)
   
   - Monthly FX limit: $500 equivalent for personal cards
     (Enough for most vacations)
   
   - Charges: 
     * Transaction is debited in Naira at current exchange rate
     * Rate: CBN rate + 3% markup
     * Example: $100 purchase = ₦150,000 (if rate is ₦1,500/$)
   
   - Common destinations with no issues:
     * UK, USA, Canada, Dubai, South Africa, Ghana
   
   - Countries with frequent declines:
     * China (use Alipay instead)
     * Some Asian countries (inform us before travel)

   **PRO TIP**: Enable 2-3 days before travel, not at the airport!


Q8: My card is stuck in the ATM. What should I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Card retention happens due to:
   - Multiple wrong PIN attempts (3+ times)
   - Suspicious activity detected by fraud system
   - Card reported lost/stolen (and you forgot)
   - Technical malfunction of ATM

   **IMMEDIATE STEPS**:
   1. Call our Customer Care IMMEDIATELY: 0700-SENTINEL
      - We will block the card instantly (prevent unauthorized use)
      - Generate incident report
   
   2. Provide ATM details:
      - Bank name and branch (e.g., "GTBank, Ikeja branch")
      - ATM location (inside bank or outside?)
      - Time of retention
   
   3. Choose retrieval OR replacement:
      
      **OPTION A: Card Retrieval** (If you need that specific card)
      - Visit the bank branch where ATM is located
      - Bring valid ID
      - Card can usually be retrieved same day (if during banking hours)
      - Some banks keep retained cards for 7 days, then destroy
      
      **OPTION B: Card Replacement** (Easier for most people)
      - Request new card (takes 3-5 business days)
      - Fee: ₦1,500 for standard card
      - Old card will be deactivated
      - New card number (you'll need to update subscriptions)
   
   4. If you need cash urgently while waiting:
      - Visit any of our branches
      - Bring valid ID
      - We can process counter withdrawal
      - Or issue temporary ATM card (₦500, valid for 7 days)

   **PREVENTION**:
   - Remember your PIN correctly
   - Don't share your PIN with anyone
   - If you forget PIN, reset it BEFORE going to ATM


=========================================================================
SECTION 3: MOBILE APP & DIGITAL BANKING
=========================================================================

Q9: I can't log into the mobile app. What's wrong?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Common causes and solutions:

   **WRONG PASSWORD**
   - Symptom: "Invalid credentials" message
   - Solution: Use "Forgot Password" option
     * Reset link sent to registered email
     * New password must be 8+ characters
     * Must include: number, uppercase letter, symbol
     * Cannot reuse last 3 passwords

   **OUTDATED APP VERSION**
   - Symptom: App crashes on opening OR "Update required" message
   - Solution: 
     * Android: Open Play Store → My Apps → Sentinel Bank → Update
     * iOS: Open App Store → Updates → Sentinel Bank → Update
   - Important: Sometimes old versions are disabled for security
   - Always keep app updated!

   **NETWORK ISSUES**
   - Symptom: "Cannot connect to server" OR endless loading
   - Solution:
     * Check your internet connection (try opening browser)
     * Switch between WiFi and mobile data
     * Try airplane mode ON for 10 seconds, then OFF
     * Clear app cache: Phone Settings → Apps → Sentinel Bank → Clear Cache

   **ACCOUNT LOCKED**
   - Symptom: "Account temporarily locked" message
   - Cause: 3 wrong password attempts
   - Solution: 
     * Account auto-unlocks after 30 minutes
     * OR call Customer Care for immediate unlock
     * OR use "Forgot Password" to reset

   **DEVICE CHANGED**
   - Symptom: "Verify your identity" OR "OTP required"
   - Cause: First login on new device (security feature)
   - Solution:
     * OTP sent to registered phone number
     * Enter OTP to verify
     * Device will be remembered for future logins
   - If not receiving OTP: Call us to verify phone number on file


Q10: I'm not receiving OTPs. How can I fix this?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Try these steps IN ORDER:

   **STEP 1: VERIFY PHONE NUMBER**
   - Call Customer Care: 0700-SENTINEL
   - Confirm: "What phone number do you have on file for my account?"
   - Problem: Sometimes number gets unlinked after SIM replacement
   - Solution: Update number if incorrect (requires branch visit with ID)

   **STEP 2: CHECK NETWORK COVERAGE**
   - Ensure you have signal (check signal bars)
   - Try moving to area with better reception
   - Switch to different network if dual SIM

   **STEP 3: CHECK MESSAGE INBOX**
   - OTP might be in spam/junk folder
   - Some phones block messages from shortcodes
   - Check "Blocked messages" in your SMS app
   - Look for sender: "SENTINEL" or "SBNK"

   **STEP 4: RESTART PHONE**
   - Simple restart often resolves stuck messages
   - Hold power button → Restart
   - Wait 1 minute, try requesting OTP again

   **STEP 5: ALTERNATIVE AUTHENTICATION**
   - Try email OTP (if available for your transaction)
   - Use hardware token (if you have one)
   - Call Customer Care for phone-based verification

   **STEP 6: VISIT BRANCH** (If all else fails)
   - Bring valid ID
   - Update phone number with proper verification
   - May require additional KYC documentation
   - Processing time: 15-30 minutes

   **FOR IPHONE USERS**:
   - Check: Settings → Messages → Filter Unknown Senders
   - If enabled, OTP may be hidden
   - Disable filter or check "Unknown Senders" folder

   **FOR ANDROID USERS**:
   - Check: Messages app → Menu → Spam & Blocked
   - OTP may be marked as spam
   - Mark sender as "Not spam"

SECTION 4: FRAUD & SECURITY
=========================================================================

Q11: I received a call from someone claiming to be from the bank asking 
     for my PIN. Is this real?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: **NO! THIS IS 100% A SCAM.**

   **What We NEVER Do**:
   ❌ We NEVER ask for your PIN via phone
   ❌ We NEVER ask for your password via phone

   ⚠️ ACT IMMEDIATELY (Every second counts!):
   
   1. Change your password RIGHT NOW
      - In the app: Menu → Settings → Change Password
      - Choose a strong, unique password
   
   2. Block your card

   3. Call our OFFICIAL number: 0700-SENTINEL
      - Do NOT call any number the scammer provided
      - Do NOT use number from the "bank email" you received
      - Use the number on the back of your debit card
      - Or find it on our official website
   
   4. Report the fraud
      - Email: fraud-desk@sentinelbank.ng
      - Provide: Scammer's phone number, what they said, what you shared
   
   5. Monitor your account
      - Check transaction history every hour for next 24 hours
      - Report any unauthorized transactions immediately

   **How to Verify If a Call Is Really From Us**:
   - Hang up and call our official number yourself
   - We will never be offended if you verify
   - Real bank staff will UNDERSTAND and APPRECIATE your caution
   - Scammers will get angry or pressure you (red flag!)

   **Common Scam Tactics** (Be Aware):
   - "Your account will be closed today if you don't act now!"
   - "We detected suspicious activity. Verify with your PIN."
   - "You've won a prize! Send ₦5,000 to claim."
   - "Your BVN needs update. Send your OTP to complete."
   - "I'm from CBN/EFCC. We need your account details."

   **REMEMBER**: 
   We will NEVER pressure you to act immediately!
   If someone is rushing you, it's a scam. Hang up.


Q12: How do I know if a transaction notification is real?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: **Genuine Bank Alerts Look Like This**:

   ✅ **From Official Sender ID**: "SENTINEL" or our registered shortcode
   ✅ **Specific Transaction Details**:
      - Exact amount debited/credited: "₦15,000.00"
      - Transaction time: "17/02/2026 2:45 PM"
      - Your current account balance: "Bal: ₦1,234,567.89"
      - Transaction type: "POS", "Transfer", "ATM", "Bill Payment"
      - Last 4 digits of your account: "...1234"
   ✅ **Professional Language**: No typos, proper grammar
   ✅ **Never Includes Links**: Real alerts don't ask you to click anything
   ✅ **Never Requests Information**: No "Reply with your PIN", etc.

   **Example of REAL Alert**:
   ```
   SENTINEL: Debit Alert
   Amt: NGN25,000.00
   Desc: POS Purchase - Shoprite Ikeja
   Bal: NGN1,456,789.12
   17Feb26 14:23
   Acct: ...4567
   ```

   **Fake Alert Warning Signs**:
   ❌ **Random Sender ID**: "BANKNG", "ALERT", "9876543210"
   ❌ **Vague Details**: "Your account has been debited" (no amount shown)
   ❌ **Poor Grammar**: "You account was debitted" (typos)
   ❌ **Clickable Links**: "Click here to reverse transaction"
   ❌ **Urgent Action Required**: "Reply STOP to reverse"
   ❌ **Requests Information**: "Send your PIN to confirm"
   ❌ **Wrong Balance**: Shows balance you never had

   **Example of FAKE Alert**:
   ```
   BANKNG: Alert!!!
   Your account has been debited. 
   Click https://fake-link.com to stop this 
   transaction now!!!
   ```

   **When In Doubt**:
   1. Login to your mobile app to verify (do NOT click links in SMS!)
   2. Check transaction history in app
   3. Call our official number: 0700-SENTINEL
   4. Visit nearest branch

   **What Scammers Hope For**:
   - You panic and click the link (installs malware)
   - You reply with sensitive information
   - You send money to "reverse" a fake transaction
   - You call the scammer's number (more social engineering)

   **Pro Tip**: 
   Save our official alert sender ID in your contacts as "Sentinel Bank REAL"
   Then you can quickly identify fake senders.
