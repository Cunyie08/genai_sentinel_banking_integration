=========================================================================
SECTION 1: TRANSFER & PAYMENT ISSUES
=========================================================================

Q1: My transfer was debited but the receiver did not get the money.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: This usually indicates a temporary NIBSS network delay or a failed
   interbank transaction (transaction_status = "failed" or "timeout").

   Step 1: Wait 2 hours — most delays self-resolve via auto-reversal.
   Step 2: Check your transaction history in the app for the reference number
           (format: TXN + 12 digits).
   Step 3: Confirm the beneficiary account number and bank with the recipient.
   Step 4: If still unresolved after 2 hours, contact us with your
           transaction reference. We will trace it via NIBSS.
   Step 5: If not received within 24 hours, automatic reversal is triggered
           and you will receive an SMS confirmation.

   Common failure reasons to quote when reporting:
     - network_error → NIBSS unreachable during transfer
     - system_timeout → Switch did not respond in time
     - issuer_unavailable → Destination bank system was offline

Q2: I sent money to the wrong account. Can it be reversed?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: Reversal is NOT automatic for wrong-account transfers. Here is the process:

   Step 1: Contact the recipient directly and request voluntary refund.
   Step 2: If unsuccessful, contact our Transaction Services Unit (TSU)
           with evidence: screenshot of intended vs. actual account number.
   Step 3: TSU will formally request recall from the beneficiary's bank.
   Step 4: Recovery takes 2–14 days depending on beneficiary cooperation.

   REVERSAL NOT POSSIBLE if: recipient has already withdrawn the funds.
   Use the "Name Enquiry" feature before every transfer to verify the
   account name matches your intended recipient.

Q3: What are my daily transfer limits?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: Limits depend on your KYC tier and account type:
     Tier 1 (basic savings, phone + name only)   : ₦50,000/day
     Tier 2 (savings/solo, BVN + NIN linked)     : ₦200,000/day
     Tier 3 (current account, full KYC)           : ₦5,000,000/day

   If exceeded: failure_reason = "daily_transaction_limit_exceeded"
   To upgrade: Visit any branch with valid photo ID + utility bill.


=========================================================================
SECTION 2: CARD ISSUES
=========================================================================

Q4: Why was my card declined even though I have sufficient balance?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: Common reasons for card decline at POS or ATM:

   1. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS DISABLED (default state)
      Enable in app: Cards → Manage Card → International Transactions ON.
      Set travel start and end dates.

   2. DAILY LIMIT EXCEEDED
      POS limit : ₦500,000/day (all cards combined)
      ATM limit : ₦100,000/day (standard) or ₦200,000 (premium)
      Resets at midnight.

   3. INCORRECT PIN (3 wrong attempts = auto-lock for 24 hours)
      Reset via app or call Customer Care.

   4. MERCHANT CATEGORY BLOCKED
      Betting, gambling, crypto exchanges are blocked by default.
      Contact us to enable specific categories.

   5. SECURITY HOLD (suspicious activity detected)
      Fraud engine applied risk block. Contact us to verify identity
      and unblock. failure_reason = "suspected_fraud" in system logs.

Q5: The ATM did not dispense cash but my account was debited.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: This is a dispense error on channel = "atm". Standard protocol:

   IMMEDIATE: Note ATM location, exact time, amount, and any receipt.
              Do NOT retry the same ATM.
   REPORT: Contact us within 24 hours with ATM details.
   RESOLUTION: Auto-reversal within 24–48 hours after terminal
               reconciliation confirms the dispense error.
   SUCCESS RATE: 99.8% of ATM dispense errors are successfully reversed.


=========================================================================
SECTION 3: MOBILE APP & DIGITAL BANKING
=========================================================================

Q6: I cannot log into the mobile app.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: Troubleshoot in this order:

   WRONG PASSWORD        → Use "Forgot Password" (reset link to email).
   OUTDATED APP VERSION  → Update via Play Store / App Store.
   NETWORK ISSUE         → Toggle airplane mode off/on. Switch between
                           WiFi and mobile data. Clear app cache.
   ACCOUNT LOCKED        → 3 wrong password attempts locks for 30 minutes.
                           Call Customer Care for immediate unlock.
   NEW DEVICE            → OTP sent to registered phone to verify new device.

   If still unable to log in after all steps → Route complaint to DCS.

Q7: I am not receiving OTPs.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A: Check in this order:

   1. Verify registered phone number is correct (call Customer Care).
   2. Check network signal and mobile data.
   3. Check SMS spam/blocked messages folder. Sender: "SENTINEL" or "SBNK".
   4. Restart phone.
   5. For iPhone: Settings → Messages → Filter Unknown Senders → disable.

   7. Visit branch with valid ID to update registered phone number if incorrect.
