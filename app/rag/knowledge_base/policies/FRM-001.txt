=========================================================================
SECTION 1: COMPREHENSIVE RED FLAGS FOR FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS
=========================================================================

To mitigate fraud before transaction completion, the middleware system
monitors every transaction for the following high-density red flags.

Each red flag has an assigned risk weight (points). Total points determine
risk score (0-100) and subsequent action.


1.1 UNUSUAL TRANSACTIONAL PATTERNS (Behavioral Biometrics)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First-time Merchant Relationship
→ Risk Weight: 15 points
→ Definition: Customer has zero historical transaction data with this 
  specific Merchant ID or web gateway
→ Example: First-ever transaction at crypto exchange Binance
→ Rationale: New merchants are higher risk; fraudsters test with new vendors


High-Velocity Transaction Frequency
→ Risk Weight: 25 points
→ Definition: More than 3 successful OR failed transactions within a 
  10-minute window (indicative of 'burst fraud')
→ Example: 5 failed card attempts followed by 1 successful transaction
→ Rationale: Card testing (trying different CVV combinations)


Odd-Hour Activity
→ Risk Weight: 20 points
→ Definition: High-value transactions (≥₦100,000) initiated between 
  12:00 AM and 5:00 AM West Africa Time
→ Example: ₦500,000 transfer at 2:47 AM
→ Rationale: Legitimate customers rarely make large transfers at night
→ Note: Exceptions exist (night shift workers, insomniacs) but pattern is clear


Device Anomaly
→ Risk Weight: 15 points
→ Definition: Transaction attempt from Device ID, IMEI, or MAC address 
  not previously white-listed for this specific account
→ Example: Transaction from brand new iPhone when customer uses Android
→ Rationale: Account takeover often involves fraudster's device


Geospatial Anomaly
→ Risk Weight: 20 points
→ Definition: Transaction location or IP address originating >100km from 
  customer's last 5 known successful login clusters
→ Example: Customer typically transacts in Lagos, sudden transaction from Kano
→ Rationale: Physical impossibility (can't be in two places at once)
→ Note: Check time delta - if last login was yesterday, travel is possible


Suspiciously Round Amounts
→ Risk Weight: 10 points
→ Definition: High-value round-number transactions (e.g., exactly ₦100,000 
  or ₦500,000) which frequently characterize social engineering scams
→ Example: ₦500,000.00 transfer (not ₦499,847.50)
→ Rationale: Scammers often demand round numbers; legitimate bills vary


1.2 High-Risk Transaction Segments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

International Transfers (No History)
→ Risk Weight: 25 points
→ Definition: Cross-border payments from accounts with no prior history 
  of international spending or travel flags
→ Example: Domestic-only customer suddenly sends $5,000 to USA
→ Rationale: Scammers often trick victims into international transfers


VASP & Crypto Exchanges
→ Risk Weight: 20 points
→ Definition: Large outflows to Virtual Asset Service Providers (Binance, 
  Coinbase, Luno, etc.), particularly from accounts categorized under 
  'Vulnerable' or 'Elderly' customer segments
→ Example: 65-year-old retiree sends ₦2M to Binance
→ Rationale: Crypto is common in romance/investment scams targeting elderly


Gambling & Betting Platform Spikes
→ Risk Weight: 15 points
→ Definition: Sudden volume increases (>300% above 30-day mean) to known 
  gambling gateways (Bet9ja, Sportybet, 1xBet, etc.)
→ Example: Customer averages ₦10K/month gambling, suddenly deposits ₦200K
→ Rationale: Compulsive gambling or account takeover


Unlinked Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transfers
→ Risk Weight: 20 points
→ Definition: Rapid fund movements to new, unrelated beneficiaries with 
  no shared history in the banking network
→ Example: 5 transfers to 5 different new beneficiaries in one day
→ Rationale: Money mule behavior or fraud cashout pattern


Authentication Failure Cascades
→ Risk Weight: 30 points
→ Definition: Multiple failed biometric or PIN attempts followed 
  immediately by a successful transaction
→ Example: 3 failed fingerprint attempts, then immediate PIN success
→ Rationale: Fraudster trying different auth methods after initial failure


1.3 Account Takeover (ATO) Indicators
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sudden Profile Modification
→ Risk Weight: 30 points
→ Definition: Change in registered email, phone number, or residential 
  address followed by an immediate transfer attempt (within 24 hours)
→ Example: Email changed at 2 PM, ₦800K transfer at 3 PM same day
→ Rationale: Classic ATO pattern - change contact info to block alerts


Credential Reset Cascades
→ Risk Weight: 30 points
→ Definition: Password OR Transaction PIN changes followed by immediate 
  high-value withdrawals (within 1 hour)
→ Example: PIN reset at 10:15 AM, ₦600K withdrawal at 10:30 AM
→ Rationale: Fraudster gains access, changes credentials, extracts funds quickly


New Device After SIM Swap
→ Risk Weight: 35 points (HIGHEST RISK)
→ Definition: Fresh app installation on new device OS, particularly when 
  following a detected SIM-swap event
→ Example: SIM swap detected Monday, new app install Tuesday, transfer Wednesday
→ Rationale: This is the #1 ATO indicator in Nigeria
→ Action: Automatic 48-hour transfer freeze should be enforced


=========================================================================
SECTION 2: DYNAMIC RISK SCORING FRAMEWORK
=========================================================================

Every transaction is processed through an AI-driven scoring engine
BEFORE authorization. Risk score = sum of all applicable red flag weights.


2.1 Risk Score Calculation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example Calculation:
  - Odd-hour transaction (2:47 AM): +20 points
  - New device detected: +15 points
  - Round amount (₦500,000.00): +10 points
  - First-time international merchant: +15 points
  ───────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Risk Score: 60 points


2.2 Risk Score Interpretation & Actions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW RISK (Score: 0-30)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Assessment: Transaction aligns with 90-day historical behavioral patterns, 
           known device, and usual location

Action: Process transaction seamlessly (frictionless experience)

Notification: Real-time SMS/App alert AFTER transaction completes
             "You sent ₦25,000 to Chukwuma Okafor via Sentinel Bank"

Example: Regular monthly electricity bill payment


MEDIUM RISK (Score: 31-60)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Assessment: Single anomaly detected (e.g., new merchant but reasonable category)

Action: Trigger Step-up Authentication
        - SMS OTP to registered phone number
        - OR Email OTP to registered email
        - Transaction held in "Pending" state for 5 minutes
        - Auto-decline if OTP not entered

Notification: "We detected unusual activity. Please confirm this transaction 
              with OTP sent to 080****1234"

Example: First purchase at new online store (Jumia, Konga)


HIGH RISK (Score: 61-85)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Assessment: Multiple red flags present (e.g., new merchant + new device + 
           odd hours)

Action: **MANDATORY PUSH-TO-APP CHALLENGE**
        - Transaction held in "Pending - Security Check" state
        - Push notification sent to registered mobile app
        - Biometric confirmation required (FaceID/Fingerprint/PIN)
        - Display full transaction details + risk reason
        - 5-minute timeout (auto-decline if no response)

Notification: "Security Alert: Verify this transaction in your Sentinel app"
              Shows: Amount, Beneficiary, Bank, Risk Reason

Example: ₦450,000 transfer at 2 AM from new device to new beneficiary


CRITICAL RISK (Score: 86-100)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Assessment: Patterns match known fraud profiles (e.g., SIM-Swap + Password 
           reset + Immediate high-value withdrawal)

Action: **BLOCK TRANSACTION IMMEDIATELY**
        - Transaction declined instantly (no OTP, no challenge)
        - Freeze account access (all channels)
        - Block all cards linked to account
        - Disable digital banking channels
        - Trigger FRM specialist review
        - Generate urgent alert to fraud team
        - Send email to registered email (NOT SMS - phone may be compromised)

Notification: "Your account has been temporarily frozen due to suspicious 
              activity. Contact us immediately: fraud-desk@sentinelbank.ng"

Example: SIM swap detected + Fresh app install + Immediate ₦2M transfer 
        to crypto exchange


=========================================================================
SECTION 3: PUSH-TO-APP AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES
=========================================================================

To eliminate the vulnerability of SMS-based OTP interception (SIM swap),
the system enforces Push-to-App challenges for high-risk transactions.


3.1 Security Hold Procedure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Transaction Pause
  - Transaction placed in "Pending - Security Verification" state
  - Maximum hold: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  - Display "Verifying transaction..." to merchant/beneficiary

Step 2: Encrypted Push Notification
  - Secure push sent to registered mobile app on verified device
  - Uses device-specific encryption key (established during app setup)
  - Cannot be intercepted like SMS

Step 3: Full Transparency Display
  The app MUST display ALL of the following:
  - Beneficiary Name (in bold)
  - Beneficiary Bank
  - Amount (including breakdown of fees)
  - Transaction Fee (e.g., ₦50 NIP fee)
  - Cybersecurity Levy (0.5% of principal)
  - Total Debit
  - Risk Reason (e.g., "New device detected", "Unusual location")
  - Transaction Reference

Step 4: User Action Required
  Options presented to customer:
  - APPROVE (green button) → Requires biometric/PIN
  - REJECT (red button) → Immediate decline

Step 5: Biometric Validation
  If customer taps APPROVE:
  - FaceID verification (iPhone)
  - OR Fingerprint verification (Android)
  - OR Secure Transaction PIN (6-digit, different from login PIN)
  - Must match enrolled biometric

Step 6: Response Handling
  
  If APPROVED:
  - Process transaction immediately
  - Log authentication method used
  - Update device trust score (+5 points toward trusted device)
  - Send confirmation: "Transaction successful"
  
  If REJECTED:
  - Cancel transaction immediately
  - Block card/account access (prevent further attempts)
  - Generate URGENT FRM alert with HIGH priority
  - Send confirmation SMS: "Transaction blocked per your request. 
    Your account is now frozen for security. Contact fraud-desk@sentinelbank.ng"
  - Assign to FRM specialist within 30 minutes

Step 7: Timeout Handling
  If no response within 5 minutes:
  - Auto-decline transaction
  - Send SMS: "Transaction timed out. If you did not initiate this, 
    contact us immediately"
  - Flag account for review (but don't freeze yet)


3.2 Why Push-to-App Replaces OTP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem with SMS OTP:
  - SIM swap attacks intercept SMS
  - SS7 vulnerabilities allow SMS interception
  - SMS can be delayed (up to hours)
  - No device binding (OTP works from any phone)

Advantages of Push-to-App:
  - Device-specific (bound to specific phone IMEI/MAC)
  - Encrypted end-to-end
  - Cannot be intercepted even with SIM swap
  - Instant delivery (no SMS gateway delays)
  - Biometric binding (can't approve without finger/face)
  - Shows full transaction details (customer sees what they're approving)


=========================================================================
SECTION 4: COMMON FRAUD SCENARIOS IN NIGERIA
=========================================================================

These are the most prevalent fraud types in Nigerian banking as of 2026.


4.1 SIM Swap Fraud
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack Pattern:
  1. Fraudster obtains customer's BVN/NIN (through data breach or phishing)
  2. Fraudster visits MNO (MTN/Airtel/Glo/9mobile) store with fake ID
  3. Fraudster convinces agent to transfer phone number to new SIM
  4. Fraudster now receives all SMS (including banking OTPs)
  5. Fraudster resets banking password via SMS OTP
  6. Fraudster drains account

Detection Controls:
  - Real-time SIM swap detection via MNO API query
  - If SIM swap detected in last 48 hours:
    * Automatic transfer freeze for Tier 1 & 2 accounts
    * Tier 3 accounts: Mandatory push-to-app challenge
    * Email notification (NOT SMS) to registered email
  
Mitigation:
  - Email-based OTP as fallback (for password reset)
  - Require branch visit for transfer reactivation after SIM swap
  - Biometric re-enrollment required
  - 48-hour cooling-off period enforced

Prevention Tips (Customer Education):
  - "Never share your BVN or NIN with anyone"
  - "Set up SIM PIN lock to prevent unauthorized SIM swaps"
  - "Use app push notifications, not SMS OTP"


4.2 Phishing & Social Engineering
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack Pattern:
  1. Customer receives call/email from "bank official"
  2. Fraudster creates urgency: "Your account will be blocked!"
  3. Fraudster pressures customer to share OTP/PIN
  4. Fraudster initiates transfer while on call with customer
  5. Customer unknowingly authorizes their own theft

Detection Controls:
  - In-app warnings during high-risk transfers:
    **"⚠️ WARNING: Sentinel Bank will NEVER ask for your PIN via phone.
    Are you being pressured into this transaction? If YES, tap REJECT."**
  
  - Voice stress analysis (future enhancement - Week 3)
  - Unusual beneficiary name patterns (e.g., "Agent", "Test", "Verification")

Mitigation:
  - Cooling-off period: 1-hour delay for first-time large beneficiaries
  - Customer education campaigns (emails, app banners, SMS)
  - Callback verification: Bank calls customer on registered number for 
    high-value first-time transfers >₦500,000

Prevention Tips:
  - "We will NEVER ask for your PIN, password, or OTP"
  - "If pressured, hang up and call our official number"
  - "Take time to think - don't rush financial decisions"


4.3 POS & Agency Banking Fraud
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack Pattern:
  1. Compromised POS terminal (malware installed)
  2. Fraudster double-charges customers
  3. OR Fraudster skims card details for cloning
  4. Customer only discovers during statement review (too late)

Detection Controls:
  - Duplicate charge detection:
    * Same terminal
    * Similar amount (within 5%)
    * Within 5 minutes
    → If detected: Auto-reverse second charge
  
  - Real-time dual-connectivity failover (prevent double-debit)
  - Terminal health monitoring (detect malware)
  - Unusual terminal activity patterns

Mitigation:
  - Automatic reversal of duplicate charges (within 24 hours)
  - Terminal blacklisting (if fraud confirmed)
  - Agent sanctions (suspension, termination, legal action)
  - Customer SMS alerts for EVERY POS transaction (real-time)

Prevention:
  - "Check your SMS alert immediately after POS payment"
  - "Report double charges within 24 hours for instant reversal"


4.4 Account Takeover (ATO)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack Pattern:
  1. Fraudster obtains login credentials (phishing, data breach)
  2. Fraudster changes email/phone in account profile
  3. Fraudster resets password (OTP goes to new email/phone)
  4. Fraudster withdraws funds
  5. Customer discovers too late (alerts went to fraudster's contact)

Detection Controls:
  - Profile change alerts to OLD contact details:
    "Your email was changed. If you didn't do this, contact us immediately"
  
  - Mandatory cooling-off period: 24-hour delay after profile changes
    before high-value transactions allowed
  
  - Multi-factor authentication for profile changes (not just password)

Mitigation:
  - Instant account freeze if customer reports ATO
  - Password reset from branch only (after ATO report)
  - Full account audit (find unauthorized changes)

Prevention:
  - "Use strong, unique passwords"
  - "Enable biometric login (harder to steal than password)"
  - "Monitor your email for profile change alerts"
