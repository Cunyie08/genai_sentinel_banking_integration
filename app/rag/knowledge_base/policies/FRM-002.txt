USAGE BY SENTINEL AGENT:
  This document provides merchant_category risk weights that are ADDED
  to the base risk score calculated from fraud_explainability_trace flags
  in FRM-001. The Sentinel Agent queries this document using the
  merchant_category field from transactions.csv and adds the returned
  risk weight to the total risk score.

QUERY PATTERN:
  Input  : transaction['merchant_category']  →  e.g., "fintech"
  Output : merchant risk weight (points)     →  e.g., +25
  Action : Add to base score from FRM-001 flags, cap total at 100.


=========================================================================
SECTION 1: MERCHANT CATEGORY RISK TIERS
=========================================================================

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TIER 1 — HIGH RISK MERCHANT CATEGORIES  (+25 points)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CATEGORY: fintech
Risk Weight       : +25 points
Known Merchants   : Paystack, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Remita, Monnify
Risk Rationale    :
  Fintech payment gateways are the PRIMARY channel for moving stolen funds
  out of compromised accounts. Fraudsters use victim accounts to fund
  merchant accounts or P2P wallets on fintech platforms, making tracing
  difficult. High-value fintech transactions from accounts with no prior
  fintech history are the strongest single fraud signal in this dataset.
Heightened Alert Conditions (add additional +10 points):
  - First-ever fintech transaction for this account
  - Amount > ₦200,000 to a fintech gateway
  - Transaction at hours between midnight and 5:00 AM WAT
  - Customer segment = "elderly" (age > 60 in customers.csv)
Sentinel Agent Rule:
  IF merchant_category = "fintech" AND is_fraud_score = 1:
    Add +25 points to risk score.
  IF merchant_category = "fintech" AND amount > 200000 AND
     no prior fintech transactions:
    Treat as if multiple_failures flag present (+20 additional).
Recommended Escalation:
  Combined score ≥ 61 (fintech + any one FRM-001 flag) → HIGH risk.
  Mandatory push-to-app challenge for ALL fintech transactions > ₦100,000
  regardless of fraud score, as a blanket protective control.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TIER 2 — MEDIUM-HIGH RISK MERCHANT CATEGORIES  (+15 points)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CATEGORY: transport
Risk Weight       : +15 points
Known Merchants   : Uber, Bolt, LagRide, ABC Transport, Peace Mass Transit
Risk Rationale    :
  Transport platforms (especially ride-hailing apps) are used as
  money-testing venues. Fraudsters initiate small Uber or Bolt transactions
  to test whether a stolen card or account access is active before
  attempting larger withdrawals. Multiple transport transactions within
  a short window is a card-testing indicator.
Heightened Alert Conditions (add additional +10 points):
  - 3+ transport transactions within 30 minutes to same platform
  - Transport transaction outside customer's residential_state
    (customers.csv: residential_state field)
  - Transport transaction at 12:00 AM – 5:00 AM WAT
Positive Contextual Signal:
  - Uber/Bolt transactions ≥ 6 in last 90 days on this account
    → REDUCES suspicion (regular commuter behavior)
  - This is the car_loan_signal_score trigger in transactions.csv
    (uber_tracker ≥ 6 adds +0.4 to car_loan_signal_score)
Sentinel Agent Rule:
  IF merchant_category = "transport" AND is_fraud_score = 1:
    Add +15 points.
  IF uber_tracker < 6 AND 3+ transport txns in 30 minutes:
    Treat as card-testing pattern. Add +15 points.

CATEGORY: education
Risk Weight       : +15 points
Known Merchants   : University Tuition, WAEC, JAMB, Private School Fees
Risk Rationale    :
  Education payments are legitimate but frequently used in social
  engineering scams. Fraudsters convince victims to make urgent "school
  fee" payments under false pretenses. Large, round-number education
  payments from accounts with no prior education payment history are
  suspicious.
Heightened Alert Conditions (add additional +10 points):
  - Payment > ₦500,000 (unusually large for typical fees)
  - No prior education transactions on this account (ever)
  - Payment destination is international (outside Nigeria)
Sentinel Agent Rule:
  IF merchant_category = "education" AND is_fraud_score = 1:
    Add +15 points.

CATEGORY: healthcare
Risk Weight       : +15 points
Known Merchants   : Teaching Hospital, Private Hospital, Medplus, HealthPlus
Risk Rationale    :
  Healthcare payments are generally legitimate but are occasionally
  used as cover for scam payments ("my mother needs surgery money").
  Large pharmacy or hospital payments from accounts with unusual
  activity patterns require secondary review.
Heightened Alert Conditions (add additional +10 points):
  - Payment > ₦1,000,000 (significantly above average healthcare spend)
  - First-ever healthcare merchant on this account
Sentinel Agent Rule:
  IF merchant_category = "healthcare" AND is_fraud_score = 1:
    Add +15 points.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TIER 3 — LOW RISK MERCHANT CATEGORIES  (+5 points)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CATEGORY: telecoms
Risk Weight       : +5 points
Known Merchants   : MTN, Airtel, Glo, 9mobile
Risk Rationale    :
  Telecom payments (airtime, data bundles) are generally low-risk but
  can indicate money-laundering via airtime resale at very high volumes.
  Standard individual top-ups are benign.
Heightened Alert Conditions (add additional +10 points):
  - Airtime purchase > ₦50,000 in single transaction (resale indicator)
  - 5+ telecom transactions in one day (bulk resale pattern)
Sentinel Agent Rule:
  IF merchant_category = "telecoms" AND is_fraud_score = 1:
    Add +5 points.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TIER 4 — ZERO-RISK MERCHANT CATEGORIES  (0 points)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These categories are established, everyday spending patterns. No additional
risk weight is added to the fraud score for transactions in these categories.

CATEGORY: supermarket
Risk Weight       : 0 points
Known Merchants   : Shoprite, SPAR, Justrite, Ebeano, Market Square
Rationale         : Essential grocery spending. Highly predictable pattern.
                    Shoprite and SPAR have robust transaction security.
Exception         : IF amount > ₦500,000 at a supermarket → flag as anomaly
                    (+15 points). Supermarkets rarely process amounts this high.

CATEGORY: restaurants
Risk Weight       : 0 points
Known Merchants   : Chicken Republic, Kilimanjaro, Mr Biggs, Dominos,
                    Cold Stone, Bukka Hut
Rationale         : Everyday food spending. Very low fraud incidence.
Exception         : IF amount > ₦200,000 at a single restaurant
                    → flag as anomaly (+15 points).

CATEGORY: fuel
Risk Weight       : 0 points
Known Merchants   : NNPC Mega Station, TotalEnergies, Mobil, Oando,
                    Conoil, MRS
Rationale         : Routine fuel purchases. Extremely predictable.
                    Amount per transaction is naturally bounded by tank size.
Exception         : IF amount > ₦100,000 at fuel station
                    → flag as anomaly (+10 points).

CATEGORY: utilities
Risk Weight       : 0 points
Known Merchants   : Ikeja Electric, EKEDC, IBEDC, AEDC, DSTV, GOtv, StarTimes
Rationale         : Utility bill payments are scheduled, predictable, and
                    directly verifiable. DSTV, GOtv, and StarTimes are
                    subscription services with fixed recurring amounts.
Exception         : IF amount > ₦500,000 for a single utility bill
                    → flag as anomaly (+10 points).


=========================================================================
SECTION 2: MERCHANT VELOCITY RULES (ADDITIONAL RISK WEIGHTS)
=========================================================================

These rules apply ON TOP OF the category risk weights above.
They are based on transaction frequency patterns, not merchant type.

First Transaction with New Merchant (on this account)
  Condition     : No prior transaction with this merchant_name on record
  Risk Weight   : +10 points
  Rationale     : New merchant relationships carry inherent uncertainty.
  Rule          : Apply to ALL categories including Tier 4 (zero-risk).

Repeated Transactions to Same Merchant in Short Window
  Condition     : 3+ transactions to same merchant within 60 minutes
  Risk Weight   : +20 points
  Rationale     : Velocity to same merchant indicates card testing,
                  session hijacking, or retry fraud pattern.

Large Single Transaction with New Merchant
  Condition     : Amount > ₦100,000 AND merchant is new to this account
  Risk Weight   : +25 points (replaces +10 new merchant weight — use higher)
  Rationale     : High-value first transaction with unknown merchant is
                  the highest-risk combination outside fintech.


=========================================================================

    fintech              : +25
  Velocity (Section 2):
    First fintech txn    : +10 (new merchant)
  ─────────────────────
  Total                  : 75 → HIGH → Mandatory push-to-app challenge

    3 txns in 30 min     : +20
  ─────────────────────
  Total                  : 55 → MEDIUM → Step-up OTP authentication

EXAMPLE 3 — SUPERMARKET NORMAL PURCHASE:
  Flags from FRM-001:
    normal_pattern       : +0
  Merchant (FRM-002):
    supermarket          : +0
  Velocity (Section 2):
    Regular merchant     : +0
  ─────────────────────
  Total                  : 0 → LOW → Process without friction

EXAMPLE 4 — FINTECH CRITICAL BLOCK:
  Flags from FRM-001:
    mobile_channel_risk  : +15
    high_amount_spike    : +25
    multiple_failures    : +20
  Merchant (FRM-002):
    fintech              : +25
  ─────────────────────
  Total                  : 85 → HIGH (capped at 85 — borderline Critical)
  Note: Add +10 for new merchant → 95 → CRITICAL → Block immediately


=========================================================================
SECTION 4: MERCHANT CATEGORY TO DEPARTMENT ROUTING
=========================================================================

If a merchant-related complaint is raised, use this table to determine
which department should handle it alongside the Sentinel fraud assessment:

  Merchant Category  → Primary Department  → Escalate to if Fraud Detected
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  fintech            → TSU (disputed txn)  → FRM (if is_fraud_score = 1)
  transport          → COC (if card used)  → FRM (if is_fraud_score = 1)
  supermarket        → COC (if POS issue)  → TSU (if transfer issue)
  restaurants        → COC (if POS issue)  → TSU (if transfer issue)
  fuel               → COC (if POS issue)  → TSU (if transfer issue)
  utilities          → TSU (bill payment)  → AOD (if charge disputed)
  telecoms           → TSU (airtime/data)  → DCS (if USSD channel)
  education          → TSU (bank transfer) → FRM (if scam suspected)
  healthcare         → TSU (bank transfer) → FRM (if scam suspected)
