=========================================================================

**Document ID**: POL-CCH-001
**Version**: 2.1  
**Effective Date**: January 2025  
**Classification**: Internal Use Only
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly

=========================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE & SCOPE
=========================================================================

This policy establishes standardized procedures for receiving, classifying,
routing, and resolving customer complaints across all channels.

Key Objectives:
1. Ensure complaints reach the correct department on first contact (>95% accuracy)
2. Maintain consistent SLA compliance across all complaint types
3. Provide transparent escalation paths for unresolved issues
4. Enable AI-driven triage and routing with full auditability

This policy provides the architectural logic for the AI Middleware to solve
the 'misrouting crisis' by ensuring tickets reach the correct subject matter
expert without manual intervention.

Scope:
- All customer-initiated complaints (regardless of channel)
- All complaint types (transactional, operational, technical, service-related)
- All customer segments (retail, SME, corporate, private banking)

Out of Scope:
- Internal operational issues (handled by separate process)
- Regulatory inquiries (escalated to Compliance immediately)
- Media inquiries (escalated to Communications department)


=========================================================================

=========================================================================
SECTION 5: PROHIBITED ACTIONS
=========================================================================

The following actions are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN and can result in
disciplinary action:


1. NEVER ROUTE FRAUD CASES TO IT DEPARTMENT
   → Fraud = FRM department always, no exceptions
   → IT handles technical issues, not security incidents
   

2. NEVER DELAY CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOR DOCUMENTATION
   → Security first, paperwork second
   → Freeze account immediately if fraud suspected, document later
   

3. NEVER PROMISE SPECIFIC RESOLUTION TIMES BEYOND PUBLISHED SLA
   → Under-promise, over-deliver
   → Say "we target 48 hours" not "I'll fix this in 2 hours"
   

4. NEVER SHARE CUSTOMER DETAILS ACROSS UNAUTHORIZED CHANNELS
   → PII protection is mandatory (NDPR compliance)
   → No customer details via WhatsApp, personal email, SMS
   

5. NEVER CLOSE TICKET WITHOUT CUSTOMER CONFIRMATION
   → Customer satisfaction is the success metric
   → Always confirm resolution with customer before closing
