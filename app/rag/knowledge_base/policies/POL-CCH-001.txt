=========================================================================

Document ID     : POL-CCH-001
Version         : 2.1
Effective Date  : January 2025
Classification  : Internal Use Only — AI Agent Operational Reference
Review Cycle    : Quarterly

=========================================================================
SECTION 1: PURPOSE & SCOPE
=========================================================================

This policy establishes standardized, deterministic procedures for
receiving, classifying, routing, and resolving customer complaints
across all service channels at Sentinel Bank Nigeria.

Primary Consumers of This Policy:
  - Dispatcher Agent: Uses routing rules in Section 2 to assign every
    inbound complaint to the correct department on first contact.
  - Sentinel Agent: Uses fraud_related field and FRM routing rules to
    escalate fraud-linked complaints immediately.
  - Human supervisors: Use escalation matrix in Section 4 for overrides.

Key Objectives:
  1. Route complaints to the correct department with >95% accuracy
     on first contact, eliminating manual re-routing overhead.
  2. Enforce SLA compliance by department (exact hours in Section 2).
  3. Provide deterministic escalation paths for every complaint tier.
  4. Enable full auditability — every routing decision must cite a
     policy section and department code from this document.

Complaint Intake Channels (complaint_channel field values):
  - call_center   : Phone call to customer care hotline
  - mobile_app    : Complaint submitted inside the Sentinel mobile app
  - email         : Complaint submitted via email
  - branch        : In-person complaint at any Sentinel Bank branch
  - social_media  : Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn DMs

SECTION 2: COMPLAINT CATEGORIES & DEPARTMENT ROUTING
=========================================================================

ROUTING DECISION LOGIC FOR DISPATCHER AGENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The Dispatcher Agent MUST evaluate fields in this exact priority order:

  STEP 1: If fraud_related == 1 OR is_fraud_score == 1
          → Route to FRM (Priority: Critical). STOP. Do not evaluate further.

  STEP 2: If transaction channel (channel field) is "atm" or "pos"
          AND transaction_status is NOT "successful"
          → Route to COC (Priority: High). STOP.

  STEP 3: If transaction_status is "failed", "timeout", or "reversed"
          AND channel is "nibss_transfer", "mobile_app", "web", or "ussd"
          → Route to TSU (Priority: High). STOP.

  STEP 4: If complaint text references app, login, USSD, crash, error
          → Route to DCS (Priority: Medium).

  STEP 5: If complaint text references statement, balance, charges,
          account closure, BVN
          → Route to AOD (Priority: Medium or Low).

  STEP 6: If complaint text references loan, credit, repayment,
          disbursement, overdraft
          → Route to CLS (Priority: Medium).

  DEFAULT: Route to TSU (Priority: Medium).

2.1  TRANSACTION SERVICES UNIT (TSU)

  - Transaction narration or reference number discrepancies

CHANNELS THAT PRIMARILY GENERATE TSU COMPLAINTS:
  nibss_transfer, mobile_app, ussd, web, branch

PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT RULES FOR TSU:
  - High   : Amount > ₦100,000 OR status = "failed"/"timeout"/"reversed"
