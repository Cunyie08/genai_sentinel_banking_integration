Automatic Reversals (No Customer Action Required)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failed Internal Transfers
  - Timeline: Within 24 hours (usually within 2 hours)
  - Process: Automatic system reversal
  - Notification: SMS + App notification
  - Example: "Transfer to Chukwuma Okafor failed due to network error. 
             ₦50,000 has been credited back to your account."

Failed NIP (Interbank) Transfers
  - Timeline: 48-72 hours
  - Process: Coordination with NIBSS required
  - Notification: Status updates every 24 hours
  - Reason for delay: Need confirmation from destination bank

Failed ATM Withdrawals (Dispense Errors)
  - Timeline: Within 24 hours (after terminal reconciliation)
  - Process: Bank reconciles terminal cash vs. transactions
  - Notification: SMS confirmation
  - Note: CRITICAL - Customer must report within 24 hours


Manual Reversal Requests (Customer Must Request)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Eligible Scenarios**:
1. Transfer to wrong account (customer's own error)
2. Duplicate transaction (charged twice for same thing)
3. Amount error (sent ₦100,000 instead of ₦10,000)

**Process**:
  Step 1: Customer logs complaint with Transaction Services Unit (TSU)
  Step 2: Investigation (2-5 business days)
          - Verify transaction was debited
          - Confirm beneficiary details
          - Check if beneficiary has received credit
  Step 3: Contact beneficiary bank for refund request
  Step 4: If beneficiary agrees: Credit applied to customer
          If beneficiary refuses: Cannot force reversal (see below)

**Important**: Bank cannot FORCE recipient to return funds.
              Recovery depends on beneficiary cooperation.


Reversal NOT POSSIBLE (Customer Bears Loss)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following reversals CANNOT be processed:

1. **Beneficiary Bank Confirms Credit AND Withdrawal**
   → Reason: Funds already withdrawn by recipient
   → Action: Customer must pursue civil recovery (legal action)
   → Example: Sent ₦500K to wrong account. Recipient withdrew same day.

2. **Value Has Been Consummated**
   → Reason: Service/product already delivered
   → Examples:
     * Airtime purchased (already loaded on phone)
     * DSTV subscription paid (already activated)
     * Utility bill paid (already posted to your account)
   → Action: Cannot reverse. Contact merchant for refund directly.

3. **Funds Liquidated/Transferred Out**
   → Reason: Recipient moved money elsewhere
   → Example: You sent to Account A. Account A owner sent to Account B.
              Cannot reverse because money not in Account A anymore.

4. **Request Made >60 Days After Transaction**
   → Reason: Outside chargeback window
   → Legal Basis: Card scheme rules (Visa/Mastercard)
   → Action: Customer can pursue civil recovery

5. **Transaction Marked as Fraudulent by Recipient**
   → Reason: Recipient claims fraud, dispute is complex
   → Action: Requires investigation by both banks + NIBSS
   → Timeline: Can take 90+ days
